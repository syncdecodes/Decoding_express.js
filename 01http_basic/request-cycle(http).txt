HTTP request–response cycle.

1. User sends an HTTP Request - types a URL or clicks a link..
   A request contains:
   Method → GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
   URL / path → /, /about
   HTTP version
   Headers → metadata (browser type, content type, etc.)
   Body (optional) → data sent to server (forms, JSON)

2. Server receives the request
   req → contains request data (URL, method, headers)
   res → used to send data back to the client

3. Server processes the request - checks the URL, read files..

4. Server sends an HTTP Response
   A response contains:
   HTTP version - generally HTTP/1.1
   Status code → 200, 100, 404, 500
   Headers → content type, length, etc.
   Body → data (HTML, JSON, text, file)

5. Browser receives the response

=> servers are just computers whose job is to make the resources available to the user
